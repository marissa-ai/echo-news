# Project Status and Next Steps

## Current State
- Project: Echo News - A full-stack news platform
- Location: `/c%3A/echo-news`
- Main components:
  - Frontend: React/Next.js (`frontend/echo`)
  - Backend: Node.js/Express
  - Database: PostgreSQL

## Test Status
Currently have 35 total tests:
- 32 passing tests
- 3 failing tests in `frontend/echo/src/__tests__/Navbar.test.jsx`:
  1. "toggles mobile menu when hamburger button is clicked"
  2. "closes mobile menu when a navigation item is clicked"
  3. "navigates to home page when logo is clicked"

## Next Steps
1. Fix failing Navbar component tests
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Commit all changes to git
4. Deploy updates

## Suggested Prompt for Next Session
```
I'm working on the Echo News project. We have 35 unit tests, with 3 failing tests in the Navbar component. Please:

1. Analyze the current test failures in frontend/echo/src/__tests__/Navbar.test.jsx
2. Help me fix these failing tests
3. Run all tests again to verify everything passes
4. Once all tests pass, help me commit the changes to git

The project is a full-stack news platform with React/Next.js frontend, Node.js backend, and PostgreSQL database. We need to maintain high code quality and test coverage.
```

## Important Directories
- Test files location: `frontend/echo/src/__tests__/`
- Main test runner: Run `cd frontend/echo && npx jest` to execute all tests

## Notes
- All tests must pass before committing to git
- Maintain existing code structure and testing patterns
- Keep test coverage high
- Follow existing code style and conventions
